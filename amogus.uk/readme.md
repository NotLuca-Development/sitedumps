# Site has a half working UI, has been exported at: 30-06-2022 11:13.
If some stuff are broken, please check the <script>, <style> or the <link> tags. If that doesn't work check console and report it here if you cannot fix it.

# IMPORTANT
I have removed the "DIE" text to prevent epileptic stuff for people who can have it. It contained flashing colours.

# Extra:
This was before the DIE text, this was the only reason AyeHosting (amogus.uk) was shutdown. <a href='https://github.com/NotLuca-Development/sitedumps/blob/main/amogus.uk/amongus.uk_exportwithspamtext.zip'>Click me to download the zip with the text spam.</a>
